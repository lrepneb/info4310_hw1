## README
- This project visualizes tree planting trends in San Francisco from 1950-2020 using two visualizations:
1. Tree Map
  - Shows where trees were planted across SF neighborhoods.
  - Each tree is plotted as a circle, with its color representing the decade it was planted.
  - Helps visualize spatial patterns in urban forestry.

2. Partitioned Bar Chart (**COMING SOON**)
  - Displays the top 5 most common tree species.
  - Bars show how many trees were planted per decade.
  - Uses the same colors as the map for consistency.
  - Helps analyze which species were popular in different time periods.
